"""
agent_runners.compat - Temporary event compatibility layer.

This module provides thin passthroughs to event types used by some code paths and tests,
without importing deprecated monolithic modules. If the canonical fba_events package is
available, its definitions are re-exported. Otherwise, structural Protocol fallbacks are
declared to satisfy type-checking and runtime attribute access.

Exports:
- TickEvent
- SetPriceCommand
