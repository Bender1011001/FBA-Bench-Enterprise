# Sponsorship

FBA-Bench runs are expensive (tokens + infra). Sponsorship directly funds:

- more frequent leaderboard updates
- longer agentic "Bankruptcy Test" runs
- additional scenarios and ablations

## How To Sponsor

### 1) Sponsor Compute Credits (Preferred)

If you can provide API credits (OpenRouter or a direct provider), we can run:

- prompt battery runs (cheap + reproducible)
- long-horizon agentic sims (expensive; best for sponsored slots)

Contact: `support [at] fba-bench [dot] com`

### 2) Sponsor A Specific Run

Email `support [at] fba-bench [dot] com` with:

- model id (example: `openai/gpt-5.2` or `deepseek/deepseek-r1`)
- provider / endpoint (OpenRouter or direct)
- which benchmark: `prompt` or `agentic`
- any constraints (days, tier, budget cap)

### 3) Donate (Crypto)

Crypto donation addresses are listed on the homepage.

## Disclosure / No Pay-To-Win

- Sponsored runs are labeled as sponsored.
- Sponsors do not get to change scoring, ranking, or published results.
- Run configs and artifacts are published so others can audit and rerun.
