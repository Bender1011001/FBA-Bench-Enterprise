## One-liners

- The bankruptcy test for AI agents: can your agent survive 365 simulated days of pricing, inventory, competitors, and shocks?
- Static benchmarks measure answers. FBA-Bench measures survival.
- Watch an e-commerce world run in real time: ticks, events, and compounding consequences.

1.
FBA-Bench Enterprise is a long-horizon business sim benchmark for AI agents.
One decision per simulated day. Feedback loops. Shocks. Competitors.
Bad choices compound. Good strategies emerge.
Try it / watch it: fbabench.com

2.
Most benchmarks are static Q&A.
Real agents fail slowly: cash bleed, stockouts, margin collapse, price wars.
FBA-Bench measures that failure mode. 180-365+ day runs.

3.
New: Simulation Theater (observer mode).
Cinematic camera + live event feed + end-of-run recap.
If your agent is doing something interesting, you should be able to record it.

4.
"Locally correct, globally fatal" is the default failure mode for agents.
FBA-Bench makes it visible. Tick-by-tick. With consequences.

5.
We split two questions cleanly:
1) How good is the model alone?
2) How good is your agent system (tools/memory/RAG)?
Stop mixing them and calling it a leaderboard.

We built FBA-Bench Enterprise to answer a simple question:
Can an AI agent run an e-commerce business without slowly killing itself?

It is a tick-based simulation (180-365+ simulated days). Each day the agent acts, the world responds, and the consequences carry forward: pricing, inventory, competitors, shocks.

We also added an observer-friendly Simulation Theater so runs are easy to understand and easy to record.

If you are evaluating agent architectures (memory, tools, control loops), this is the benchmark we wanted to exist.

Most benchmarks are designed like exams: static prompts, single-turn answers, a score.
That is useful for measuring isolated capability, but it does not tell you if an agent can survive a stateful environment where mistakes compound.

FBA-Bench Enterprise is a long-horizon e-commerce simulation benchmark:
- one decision step per simulated day (180-365+ steps)
- persistent world state (inventory, cash, competitors)
- adversarial events (supply shocks, price wars, demand spikes)
- objective metrics (profit, survival, stability)

We also built a Simulation Theater (observer mode) to make runs visual: live feed, cinematic camera, and end-of-run recap. If your agent is doing something interesting, you should be able to show it.

Title:
AI Agent Runs an E-commerce Business for 365 Days (Simulation)

Description:
Tick-based business sim benchmark: pricing, inventory, competitors, shocks.
This is what "agentic" failure looks like when mistakes compound over time.

## Discord/Slack announcement

FBA-Bench Enterprise update:
- Observer-friendly Simulation Theater (cinematic camera, live feed, end recap)
- Long-horizon agent evaluation (180-365+ day runs, compounding consequences)

If you want to compare agent architectures (not just models), this is the sandbox.
