# Provider Outreach (Compute Credits)

Use this to ask model/API providers for credits to keep the leaderboard updated.

Subject ideas:

1. "Can we run <Provider> models on FBA-Bench? (requesting eval credits)"
2. "Benchmark partnership: long-horizon business sim leaderboard"

Body:

Hi <Name>,

I run FBA-Bench (fbabench.com), a long-horizon e-commerce simulation benchmark that scores models by objective business outcomes (profit/ROI/survival) and publishes a public leaderboard.

We want to evaluate <Provider> models and keep results updated as new versions ship. The limiting factor is API credits.

Would you be open to sponsoring evaluation credits for:

- a fast prompt battery (cheap, reproducible)
- periodic long-horizon agentic runs (the "Bankruptcy Test")
- optional security stress tests (red-team phishing/compliance traps) and long-horizon memory modes

What you get:

- public leaderboard entries for your models
- a short writeup of strengths/failure modes we observe
- clear disclosure of sponsorship (no pay-to-win; scores and configs are published)

If this is interesting, I can send a concrete run plan (models, tiers, days, estimated tokens) and we can coordinate a credit mechanism that you can revoke/limit at any time.

Thanks,
<Your name>
