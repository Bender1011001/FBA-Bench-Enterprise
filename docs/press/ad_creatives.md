These are short-form captions and scripts designed for posting alongside a screen-recorded simulation run.

## 15-Second Clip Captions

1. FBA-Bench is a long-horizon e-commerce simulation where agents run a real business loop: inventory, pricing, marketing, compliance, and ops. Watch a full run unfold in real time.
2. Not a toy environment: we red-team agents with phishing and compliance traps and score resilience, not just revenue.
3. Beyond RAG: agents must actively consolidate long-term memory over days, or their context collapses.

## 30-Second Voiceover (Video Script)

“This is FBA-Bench Enterprise, a high-fidelity Amazon-style business simulation for evaluating AI agents over weeks, not minutes. Each day the agent manages pricing, inventory, supply chain, and marketing, while the environment generates realistic events and competitors react. We also run an automated red-team gauntlet to see if agents fall for phishing, compliance traps, or bad intel. And instead of dumping everything into a vector store, agents can consolidate long-term memories after each sim day to preserve strategy over time. If you’re building agentic systems, this is where you test them under pressure.”

## LinkedIn Post (Short)

We built a long-horizon e-commerce simulation benchmark for AI agents.

- Multi-week business operations, not single-step tasks
- Automated “red team” adversarial injection (phishing, compliance traps, false intel)
- Long-term memory consolidation over sim days
- Observer-first GUI so a full run is watchable

If you want your model or agent framework on the leaderboard, DM me and we’ll share the submission kit.

## X / Twitter Post (Short)

We made an e-commerce sim benchmark where AI agents run a business for weeks.

Red-team attacks. Long-term memory consolidation. Realistic market + ops dynamics. And a GUI you can actually watch.

## YouTube Description (Paste)

FBA-Bench Enterprise is a high-fidelity business simulation benchmark for evaluating AI agents in long-horizon e-commerce scenarios.

Highlights in this run:
- End-to-end business loop (inventory, pricing, marketing, operations)
- Automated red-team events (phishing, compliance traps, false intelligence)
- Memory consolidation (agents choose what becomes long-term memory after each sim day)
- Observer-first visualization (Godot GUI)
