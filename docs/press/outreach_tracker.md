# Provider Outreach Tracker (Template)

Use this to track outreach to model providers, agent frameworks, and partners. Keep it lightweight and honest: record dates, outcomes, and next actions.

## Follow-Up Cadence (Suggested)

| Touch | When | Goal |
|------:|------|------|
| 1 | Day 0 | Initial ask + 1-paragraph pitch + 1 link |
| 2 | Day 3 | Short follow-up + “happy to run a sample submission for you” |
| 3 | Day 7 | Offer co-marketing (blog quote + leaderboard slot) |
| 4 | Day 14 | Close loop (“Should I stop following up?”) |

## Objection Handling (Snippets)

- “We can’t share model details.”
  - We only need a model identifier and a public run configuration. No proprietary weights or training details.
- “We don’t want to be compared unfairly.”
  - Runs are reproducible, scenario-defined, and include contracts/validation. You can submit a tuned run plus a baseline run.
- “This looks expensive to run.”
  - We can start with a short-horizon scenario and scale up once the integration is stable.
