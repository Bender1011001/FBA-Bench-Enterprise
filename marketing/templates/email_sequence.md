# Multi-Touch Outbound Email Sequence Template

## Overview and Personalization Guidance

This template provides a 5-email sequence for enterprise outreach targeting Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) in sectors like SaaS, FinTech, Healthcare, and more. The sequence builds awareness of FBA-Bench Enterprise's value in standardizing AI model evaluations, addressing pain points, and driving meetings.

**How to Use:**
- Import the ICP CSV from `../targets/top20_icp.csv` into a mail merge tool (e.g., HubSpot, Outreach.io, or Google Sheets with add-ons).
- Replace merge tags (e.g., {{COMPANY}}) with data from CSV columns.
- Personalize further: Research the contact's recent posts or company news to add 1-2 specific details (e.g., "Saw your team's recent scaling challenges at [Event]").
- Cadence: Send on specified days; pause on reply or opt-out.
- Length: Keep under 150 words per email for high engagement.
- Testing: A/B test subject lines; track opens/replies.
- Opt-out: Include in every email; honor immediately.

**Line-by-Line Personalization Instructions:**
- Use CSV data for core tags (e.g., {{COMPANY}} from "company" column).
- Tailor {{PAIN_POINT}} and {{ROI}} based on "key_pain_points" and company context.
- Insert {{MEETING_LINK}} as a Calendly/Zoom placeholder (e.g., https://example.com/demo?{{COMPANY}}).
- Add sender signature at the end (name, role, contact, company).
