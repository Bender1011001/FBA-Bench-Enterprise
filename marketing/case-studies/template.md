USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
- Duplicate this template for each new case study.
- Replace all {{MERGE_TAGS}} with actual customer data (keep private; anonymize for public versions).
- Use placeholders like {{BASELINE_COST}} for quantifiable metrics; provide examples in brackets [e.g., $50,000 annually].
- Ensure no PII or sensitive info is committed; use generic examples only in repo.
- Sections are structured for easy PDF export: Use headings, bullets, and short paragraphs.

# Case Study Template: {{CUSTOMER_NAME}}

**Customer:** {{CUSTOMER_NAME}} | **Industry:** {{INDUSTRY}} | **Region:** {{REGION}}

## Executive Summary
[Provide 3-5 sentences summarizing the key outcomes. Highlight the main challenge, FBA-Bench solution, and measurable impact. Example: {{CUSTOMER_NAME}}, a leading {{INDUSTRY}} firm in {{REGION}}, faced {{CHALLENGE_SUMMARY}}. By implementing FBA-Bench Enterprise, they achieved {{KEY_RESULT}}, resulting in {{ROI_HIGHLIGHT}}.]

## Challenges
[Describe the customer's pre-FBA-Bench pain points in 3-5 bullets. Quantify where possible with before metrics. Examples:]
- High manual evaluation costs: {{BASELINE_COST}} [e.g., $100,000 annually in labor].
- Inconsistent agent performance: {{ERROR_RATE}}% error rate [e.g., 15% false positives in simulations].
- Slow iteration cycles: {{TIME_TO_INSIGHT}} [e.g., 4 weeks per benchmark cycle].
- Compliance risks: {{RISK_EXPOSURE}} [e.g., manual audits leading to SOC 2 gaps].
- Limited scalability: {{SCALING_ISSUE}} [e.g., unable to test >10 agents/month].

## Solution
[Explain how FBA-Bench Enterprise addressed the challenges. Focus on features used, integrations, and customization. Examples:]
- Automated benchmarking with {{FEATURE_1}} [e.g., tiered scenarios for e-commerce agents].
- Integration with existing stack: {{INTEGRATIONS}} [e.g., CI/CD pipelines and data lakes].
- Enterprise-grade security: {{SECURITY_FEATURES}} [e.g., RBAC and audit logs].
- Custom scenarios tailored to {{INDUSTRY}} needs [e.g., financial compliance simulations].

## Implementation
[Outline the deployment process, timeline, roles, and any constraints overcome. Examples:]
- **Timeline:** {{TIMELINE}} [e.g., 8-week rollout: Weeks 1-2 discovery, 3-5 integration, 6-8 optimization].
- **Team Roles:** {{ROLES}} [e.g., Customer: AI Lead and DevOps; FBA-Bench: Solutions Engineer].
- **Constraints Addressed:** {{CONSTRAINTS}} [e.g., On-prem requirements met via VPC deployment; data migration in 48 hours].
- Key milestones: Proof-of-concept in Week 2, full production in Week 6.

## Results & Impact
[Detail KPIs with before/after comparisons, % deltas, and absolute units. Use tables or bullets for clarity. Examples:]
- **Labor Savings:** Reduced evaluation hours from {{BASELINE_HOURS}} [e.g., 500/month] to {{POST_HOURS}} [e.g., 200/month], a {{TIME_SAVED_PCT}}% reduction [e.g., 60%].
- **Cost Reduction:** Tool expenses dropped from {{BASELINE_TOOL_COST}} [e.g., $20,000/month] to {{POST_TOOL_COST}} [e.g., $8,000/month], saving {{COST_SAVINGS}} [e.g., $144,000 annually].
- **Error Rate Improvement:** From {{BASELINE_ERROR_RATE}} [e.g., 12%] to {{POST_ERROR_RATE}} [e.g., 3%], avoiding {{ERROR_COST_AVOIDANCE}} [e.g., $500,000 in revenue at risk].
- **Revenue Uplift:** {{REVENUE_UPLIFT}} [e.g., 25% faster agent deployments leading to $2M additional revenue].
- Overall impact: {{QUALITATIVE_IMPACT}} [e.g., Enabled scaling to 50+ agents/month with zero compliance incidents].

## ROI Summary
[Embed example ROI calculations from the tool. Point to roi_calculator.xlsx for full details. Customize with customer-specific inputs.]
- **Total Savings:** {{TOTAL_SAVINGS}} [e.g., $300,000 annually from labor, tools, errors, and uplift].
- **Investment Cost:** {{INVESTMENT_COST}} [e.g., $50,000 initial setup].
- **Net Benefit:** {{NET_BENEFIT}} [e.g., $250,000].
- **ROI %:** {{ROI_PCT}} [e.g., 500%].
- **Payback Period:** {{PAYBACK_MONTHS}} [e.g., 2 months].

## Compliance & Risk
[Discuss data handling, security, and risk mitigation. Examples:]
- **Data Security:** All evaluations use anonymized datasets; compliant with {{COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS}} [e.g., GDPR, SOC 2 Type II].
- **Risk Posture:** Reduced deployment risks by {{RISK_REDUCTION}}% [e.g., 80%] through automated testing.
- **Auditability:** Full traceability with {{AUDIT_FEATURES}} [e.g., immutable logs and role-based access].
