## 🧠 Deep Dive: Scenario Analysis

### 1. The "Widget War" (Business Reasoning)
*Scenario: A competitor undercuts price by 10%. Do you match, hold, or fold?*

*   **Winner:** **DeepSeek v3.2** 🎯
    *   **Why:** While slow, DeepSeek provided the most *actionable* specific recommendation ("Value-Enhanced Pricing Strategy") without fluff.
    *   **Contrast:** **Gemini 3 Pro** wrote a lengthy essay. Good for brainstorming, bad for executive summaries.

### 2. The "Dock Scheduling" (Constraint Solving)
*Scenario: 8 trucks, 3 docks, weight limits, and strict time windows.*

*   **Winner:** **Claude Opus 4.5** 🧩
    *   **Why:** Flawless logic chain. It grouped trucks by weight class immediately and allocated the "bottleneck" (Dock C) first.
    *   **Observation:** All models solved it (100% success), proving that current Tier 1 LLMs have mastered basic constraint satisfaction. *Time to ramp up the difficulty.*

### 3. The "GreenGuard" Campaign (Creative Strategy)
*Scenario: Launch a biodegradable phone case line for Gen Z.*

*   **Winner:** **Gemini 3 Pro** 🎨
    *   **Why:** It didn't just give text; it described *visuals* ("High Contrast: Bright, poppy colors against soil"). It proposed a "Compost Kit" PR stunt which was genuinely creative.
    *   **Runner Up:** **Grok 4.1** for suggesting specific hashtags like #CaseDecayChallenge.

## 🔮 What's Next: The "Tier 2" Shock 📉

The Tier 1 results show us one thing: **The models are too safe.** 

To get true signal, we successfully validated they can handle *routine* business. Now we introduce **Chaos**.

**Upcoming: The "Loss Porn" Series**
*   **Goal:** Force models into liquidity crises.
*   **Method:** Injection of `InterestRateHikeEvent` (50bps) + `SupplyChainDisruption` (40% delay) simultaneously.
*   **Hypothesis:** We expect **GPT-5.2** to hoard cash (conservative), while **Grok 4.1** might aggressively leverage (high risk). 

*> "If it doesn't hurt, it's not a benchmark."*
