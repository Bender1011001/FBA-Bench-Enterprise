**Tweet 1 (The Hook):**
Just ran the first major FBA-Bench of 2026. 
We pitted GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1 against our enterprise logic suite.

The result?
- Grok is the Speed King (16s avg) ⚡
- Claude is the Logic Sniper (100% precision) 🎯
- GPT-5.2 is... getting heavy 🐢

Full breakdown 👇

**Tweet 2 (The Data):**
Leaderboard:
1. Grok 4.1 Fast: 16.1s | 100% Success
2. Gemini 3 Pro: 22.0s | 100% Success
3. Claude Opus: 24.3s | 100% Success

Top Insight: "Reasoning" is solved for basic biz logic. The new frontier is *Crisis Management*.

**Tweet 3 (The Teaser):**
We're bored of green checkmarks. ✅
So next week, we launch **Tier 2 Advanced**:
- 75bps Rate Hikes
- Global Supply Chain collapse
- Viral Short Squeezes

We don't want to see if agents can *calculate* profit.
We want to see if they can *survive* insolvency. 📉☠️

**Headline:** reliability is the new benchmark.

We just concluded the Q1 2026 FBA-Bench Enterprise analysis. The field is tighter than ever.

**The Key Takeaways:**
*   **Commoditization of Logic:** All top 5 models (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek) scored 100% on our standard Business Constraint Handling tests.
*   **Divergence in Style:** While they all solved the problems, *how* they did it varied wildly. Gemini creates "visual" strategies; DeepSeek offers bulletproof execution plans; Grok maximizes velocity.

**What's Missing?**
Generic benchmarks test *peace-time* capabilities. At FBA-Bench, we are building the "War Room" test. 
Our upcoming **Tier 2 Scenario** injects liquidity crises and macro shocks to test Agent resilience. 

Stay tuned to see which Multi-Million Dollar agent goes bankrupt first.
