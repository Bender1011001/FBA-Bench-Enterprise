"""
Compatibility shim module for legacy imports:

Tests and legacy code often use:
    from events import TickEvent, SaleOccurred, CompetitorPricesUpdated, ...

This shim re-exports the canonical event definitions from src/fba_events
so that all components (tests, services, orchestrator) reference the same classes.
It imports CONCRETE symbols from their defining modules to guarantee single-class identity.
