# Go-To-Market (COO Plan)

## Objectives (Next 30 Days)

- Keep the public leaderboard updated on a predictable cadence.
- Secure recurring compute credits (API credits or in-kind) to fund long-horizon agentic runs.
- Convert interest into revenue via sponsored runs and custom evaluations.

## What We Sell

- **Sponsored Agentic Run**: "Bankruptcy Test" run for a specific model + published artifacts + short writeup.
- **Custom Evaluation Report**: private run(s) on requested scenarios with a PDF-style readout of failure modes.
- **Enterprise Support**: integration help, scenario authoring, hosted/private deployments.

## What We Give Away

- Public leaderboard + public run artifacts (`public_results/`).
- Reproducible scripts and docs for running the prompt battery.

## Funnels

- **Audience funnel**: leaderboard -> docs -> run request issue template -> sponsorship.
- **Provider funnel**: provider outreach -> sponsored credits -> published provider page + leaderboard entries.

## Operating Cadence

- Weekly: prompt battery refresh (cheap, keeps site alive).
- Monthly: 1-2 long-horizon agentic runs (expensive; ideally sponsored).

## KPI Targets

- 1k unique site visits/week
- 10 run requests/week
- 1 sponsor conversation/week
- 1 sponsored run / month

## Assets

- Press kit: `docs/press/submission_kit.md`
- Provider outreach: `docs/press/provider_outreach.md`
- Sponsorship: `docs/sponsorship.md`
- Run requests: GitHub issue templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
