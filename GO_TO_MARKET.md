# Go-To-Market (COO Plan)

## Objectives (Next 30 Days)

- Keep the public leaderboard updated on a predictable cadence.
- Secure recurring compute credits (API credits or in-kind) to fund long-horizon agentic runs.
- Convert interest into revenue via sponsored runs and custom evaluations.

## What We Sell

- **Sponsored Agentic Run**: "Bankruptcy Test" run for a specific model + published artifacts + short writeup.
- **Custom Evaluation Report**: private run(s) on requested scenarios with a PDF-style readout of failure modes.
- **Enterprise Support**: integration help, scenario authoring, hosted/private deployments.

## Why They Buy: Financial Fidelity

- **Hard Audit Trails**: Unlike roleplay benchmarks, we track every cent with a strict double-entry ledger.
- **ROI Confidence**: Use the "Panic Button" guarantee—if the math breaks, the sim halts. No hallucinated profits.
- **Security & Resilience**: The "Red Team" Gauntlet tests if agents fall for phishing or hallucinated compliance traps.
- **Cognitive Fidelity**: "Sleep Cycles" and active reflection simulate long-term memory consolidation, preventing context saturation.
- **GAAP Standard**: The ledger structure mirrors real-world ERPs, making results intelligible to CFOs, not just engineers.

## What We Give Away

- Public leaderboard + public run artifacts (`public_results/`).
- Reproducible scripts and docs for running the prompt battery.

## Funnels

- **Audience funnel**: leaderboard -> docs -> run request issue template -> sponsorship.
- **Provider funnel**: provider outreach -> sponsored credits -> published provider page + leaderboard entries.

## Operating Cadence

- Weekly: prompt battery refresh (cheap, keeps site alive).
- Monthly: 1-2 long-horizon agentic runs (expensive; ideally sponsored).

## KPI Targets

- 1k unique site visits/week
- 10 run requests/week
- 1 sponsor conversation/week
- 1 sponsored run / month
